## Overview

The **Report Agent** transforms raw analytics data into professional, readable reports using Gemini. It supports:
- **Summary Reports**: Quick executive summaries (~250-300 words)
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis
- **Financial Reports**: Structured reports with executive summary, metrics, trends, and recommendations (~500-600 words)
- **Email Delivery**: Sandbox (preview) and production (real emails) modes

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Report Generation
Uses Gemini to transform structured data into natural language reports with:
- Professional tone and formatting
- Data-driven insights
- Actionable recommendations
- Customizable templates

### 2. Email Integration
Sends reports via Gmail SMTP with:
- Sandbox mode for development (preview only)
- Production mode for real email delivery
- Error handling and status tracking

## Walkthrough

Open `src/lib/agents/report.ts` and review the main methods:

1. **`generateReport()`** - Basic summary/detailed reports
2. **`generateFinancialReport()`** - Structured financial reports
3. **`sendEmail()`** - Email delivery with sandbox/production modes
4. **`generateEcommerceInsights()`** - Specialized ecommerce analysis

## Exercise 1: Understanding Financial Reports

The `generateFinancialReport` method is already implemented! Let's understand its structure:

<Exercise title="Review the financial report template">

The method creates a comprehensive 4-section report:

**1. Executive Summary**
- Brief overview of key findings (2-3 sentences)
- Overall business health assessment
- Time period covered

**2. Key Metrics** (Bullet Points)
- Revenue, transactions, customer counts
- Conversion rates and averages
- Growth rates and comparisons

**3. Trends Analysis**
- Purchasing behavior patterns
- Product/category/brand performance
- Customer engagement signals
- Time-based trends and anomalies

**4. Recommendations**
- Actionable business insights
- Revenue growth strategies
- Optimization opportunities
- Risk mitigation

<Hint title="Implementation (click to reveal)">
```typescript
async generateFinancialReport(data: any): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `
  Using this ecommerce financial data, create a comprehensive financial report with the following structure:
  
  1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
     - Brief overview of key findings (2-3 sentences)
     - Overall business health assessment
     - Period covered by the data
  
  2. KEY METRICS
     - Present as bullet points with actual numbers
     - Include revenue, transactions, customer metrics
     - Highlight conversion rates and averages
     - Show growth rates if available
  
  3. TRENDS ANALYSIS
     - Identify patterns in purchasing behavior
     - Product, category, or brand performance insights
     - Customer engagement and retention signals
     - Time-based trends and anomalies
  
  4. RECOMMENDATIONS
     - Actionable insights based on the data
     - Strategic suggestions for revenue growth
     - Product/category optimization opportunities
     - Customer acquisition and retention strategies
  
  Data:
  ${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
  
  Style: Professional, executive-level, data-driven
  Format: Use clear headings, bullet points, and specific numbers
  Length: Comprehensive but focused (~500-600 words)
  Tone: Confident, analytical, solution-oriented
  `;

  const result = await this.model.generateContent(prompt);
  return result.response.text();
}
```
</Hint>

**Try in the Report Demo:**
- Select "Financial" report type
- Choose "Revenue Data" or "Top Products" as data source
- Click "Generate Report & Send Email"
- Review the structured 4-section output

</Exercise>

## Exercise 2: Email Delivery Modes

The `sendEmail` method supports both sandbox and production modes:

<Exercise title="Understanding email delivery">

The method automatically detects the environment:

**Sandbox Mode** (Development)
- `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`
- Logs email preview to console
- Returns success without sending
- Safe for testing and workshops

**Production Mode**
- `NODE_ENV === 'production'`
- Sends real emails via Gmail SMTP
- Requires Gmail credentials configured
- Returns actual send status

<Hint title="Implementation (click to reveal)">
```typescript
async sendEmail(recipient: string, subject: string, body: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Preview email in console
  console.log(`📧 Email Preview (Sandbox Mode):`);
  console.log(`To: ${recipient}`);
  console.log(`Subject: ${subject}`);
  console.log(`Body:\n${body}`);
  
  try {
    // In development/sandbox mode, just log and return success
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      console.log('✅ Email would be sent in production mode');
      return true;
    }
    
    // In production, send via Gmail API
    const result = await this.gmailClient.send({ 
      recipient, 
      subject, 
      body 
    });
    
    console.log('✅ Email sent successfully');
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Email send failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```
</Hint>

**Test Email Delivery:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Generate a report with an email address
3. Check console for the email preview
4. Look for "📧 Email Preview (Sandbox Mode)" output

</Exercise>

## Exercise 3: Using Different Data Sources

The Report Demo lets you test with different ecommerce data:

<Exercise title="Compare report outputs">

Try generating reports with different data sources:

**Revenue Data:**
```json
{
  "total_revenue": 1234567.89,
  "total_purchases": 8542,
  "unique_customers": 3421,
  "avg_revenue_per_customer": 360.85
}
```

**Top Products Data:**
```json
[
  {
    "product_id": 12345,
    "brand": "Samsung",
    "category_code": "electronics.smartphone",
    "purchase_count": 542,
    "total_revenue": 542000,
    "avg_price": 999.99
  },
  // ... more products
]
```

**Questions to Explore:**
- How does Gemini structure insights differently for revenue vs. product data?
- What recommendations change based on the data type?
- How does the financial template adapt to different metrics?

</Exercise>

<Checkpoint items={[
  "Financial report contains all 4 sections (Executive Summary, Key Metrics, Trends, Recommendations)",
  "Email preview displays in console with recipient and subject",
  "Different report types (summary/detailed/financial) generate different outputs",
  "Data source selection changes the report content appropriately",
  "Email status (sent/preview) is tracked and displayed"
]} />

## Advanced: Custom Report Templates

Want to create your own report templates? Here's how:

### Add a New Report Type
```typescript
async generateEcommerceInsights(data: any): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `
  Analyze this ecommerce data and provide strategic business insights:
  
  ${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
  
  Focus on:
  1. Revenue Optimization
     - High-value products and categories
     - Pricing opportunities
     - Cross-sell and upsell potential
  
  2. Customer Behavior
     - Purchase patterns
     - Customer segmentation opportunities
     - Engagement and retention signals
  
  3. Product Performance
     - Top and bottom performers
     - Category trends
     - Brand positioning
  
  4. Actionable Recommendations
     - Inventory management
     - Marketing focus areas
     - Product development opportunities
  
  Format: Clear sections with bullet points
  Style: Strategic, executive-level, actionable
  `;

  const result = await this.model.generateContent(prompt);
  return result.response.text();
}
```

### Create Custom Email Templates
```typescript
const REPORT_TEMPLATES = {
  executive: `
# Executive Report

## Overview
{overview}

## Key Findings
{findings}

## Strategic Recommendations
{recommendations}
`,
  technical: `
# Technical Analysis Report

## Data Summary
{summary}

## Detailed Metrics
{metrics}

## Technical Insights
{insights}
`
};
```
